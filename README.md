Users can create an account with their email and phone number, sell new items, view the items they are selling, view a list of all items for sale, view detailed information about a product, place bids on items, track the location of items, upload media, and view sold items.

## Technology Stack

- HTML, CSS and Javascript for the frontend.

- SQL for the database.
- APIs like LocationIQ for location information.

```

## User Authentication and Registration
This feature will allow users to create an account, log in, and log out. It is crucial for the proper functioning of the platform as all other features depend on a user being logged in.

## Item Creation and Listing
This feature allows users to create and list new items for sale. It includes capturing the item name, photo, description, and date and time of the listing.

## Bidding System
The bidding system is the core feature of the platform. It allows users to place bids on items, captures the maximum bid amount, updates the current bid, and sends email notifications to the users when they are outbid or win an auction.
